                        <dfn class="font-weight-bold">Solar power</dfn> is the conversion of energy from sunlight into electricity, either directly using photovoltaics (PV), indirectly using concentrated solar power, or a combination. Photovoltaic cells
                        convert light into an electric current using the photovoltaic effect. Photovoltaics were initially solely used as a source of electricity for small and medium-sized applications, from the calculator powered by a single solar cell
                        to remote homes powered by an off-grid rooftop PV system. Many industrialized nations have installed significant solar power capacity into their grids to supplement or provide an alternative to conventional energy sources while
                        an increasing number of less developed nations have turned to solar to reduce dependence on expensive fuels.

                        Most of the solar panel options currently available fit in one of three types: monocrystalline, polycrystalline (also known as multi-crystalline), and thin-film. These solar panels vary in how they’re made, appearance, performance, costs, and the installations
                        each are best suited for. Depending on the type of installationyou’re considering, one option may be more suitable than the others.

                    <h6>The major types of solar panels</h6>
                    <p id="paragraph" class="lead mt-2">
                        There are three major types of solar panels: monocrystalline, polycrystalline, and thin-film. Each type has its own unique advantages and disadvantages, and the solar panel type best suited for your installation will depend on factors specific to your
                        own property and desired system characteristics.
                    </p>
                    <h6>What are different solar panels made of? </h6>
                    <p id="paragraph" class="lead mt-2">
                        To produce electricity, solar cells are made from a semiconducting material that converts light into electricity. The most common material used as a semiconductor during the solar cell manufacturing process is silicon. Both monocrystalline and polycrystalline
                        solar panels have cells made of silicon wafers. To build a monocrystalline or polycrystalline panel, wafers are assembled into rows and columns to form a rectangle, covered with a glass sheet, and framed together. While both of
                        these types of solar panels have cells made from silicon, monocrystalline and polycrystalline panels vary in the composition of the silicon itself. Monocrystalline solar cells are cut from a single, pure crystal of silicon. Alternatively,
                        polycrystalline solar cells are composed of fragments of silicon crystals that are melted together in a mold before being cut into wafers.
                    </p>
                    <p id="paragraph" class="lead mt-2">
                        Unlike monocrystalline and polycrystalline solar panels, thin-film panels are made from a variety of materials. The most prevalent type of thin-film solar panel is made from cadmium telluride (CdTe). To make this type of thin-film panel, manufacturers
                        place a layer of CdTe between transparent conducting layers that help capture sunlight. This type of thin-film technology also has a glass layer on the top for protection. Thin-film solar panels can also be made from amorphous
                        silicon (a-Si), which is similar to the composition of monocrystalline and polycrystalline panels. Though these thin-film panels use silicon in their composition, they are not made up of solid silicon wafers. Rather, they’re composed
                        of non-crystalline silicon placed on top of glass, plastic, or metal. Lastly, Copper Indium Gallium Selenide (CIGS) panels are another popular type of thin-film technology. CIGS panels have all four elements placed between two
                        conductive layers (i.e. glass, plastic, aluminum, or steel), and electrodes are placed on the front and the back of the material to capture electrical currents.

                    <h6>Solar panel power and efficiency ratings </h6>
                    <strong class="text-info">Monocrystalline and polycrystalline solar panels</strong><br>
                    <p id="paragraph" class="lead mt-2">
                        Of all panel types, monocrystalline typically have the highest efficiencies and power capacity. Most monocrystalline solar panels often reach efficiencies higher than 20 percent, while polycrystalline solar panels usually have efficiencies between 15
                        to 17 percent. Monocrystalline solar panels tend to generate more power than other types of panels not only because of their efficiency but because they have come in higher wattage modules as well. Many monocrystalline solar panels
                        come with more than 300 watts (W) of power capacity, some reaching more than 350 W. Polycrystalline solar panels, on the other hand, tend to have lower wattages. This doesn’t mean that monocrystalline and polycrystalline solar
                        panels aren’t physically the same size - in fact, both types of solar panels tend to come with 60 silicon cells each, with 72 or 96 cell variants (usually for large-scale installations). But even with the same number of cells,
                        monocrystalline panels are capable of producing more electricity.
                    </p>
                    <h6>Type of panel best for your installation</h6>
                    <p id="paragraph" class="lead mt-2">
                        Property owners with a lot of space for solar panels can save money upfront by installing lower efficiency, lower-cost polycrystalline panels. If you have limited space available and are looking to maximize your electric bill savings, you can do so by
                        installing high-efficiency, monocrystalline solar panels. As far as thin-film panels go, it’s most common to choose this type of solar panel if you’re installing on a large, commercial roof that cannot handle the additional weight
                        of traditional solar equipment. These types of roofs can also afford the lower efficiencies of thin-film panels because they have more area to place them on. Additionally, thin-film panels can sometimes be a useful solution for
                        portable solar systems, like on RVs or boats.
