                        One may think what is the purpose of series, parallel or series-parallel connections of batteries or which is the right configuration to charge storage, battery bank system, off grid system or solar panel installation. Well, It depends on the system requirement
                        i.e. to increase the voltages by series connection of batteries, battery ampere hours (as batteries are rated in Ah instead of Amperes) or simply the current or power of batteries by connecting the batteries in parallel or series-parallel
                        to maintain the system according to your needs. If you need to know how to do it, read the following step by step tutorial about primary (non-rechargeable like AAA cells) and secondary (rechargeable like Lead Acid, Nickel Cadmium,
                        Nickel Metal Hydride, Lithium-Ion etc) batteries configuration.

                        Series, Parallel and Series-Parallel Connection of Solar Panels
                    </h4>
                    <p id="border"></p>
                    <h5 class="mt-3">Why Parallel?</h5>
                    <p id="paragraph" class="lead">
                        Strictly parallel connections are mostly utilized in smaller, more basic systems, and usually with PWM Controllers, although they are exceptions. Connecting your panels in parallel will increase the amps and keep the voltage the same. This is often used
                        in 12V systems with multiple panels as wiring 12V panels in parallel allows you to keep your charging capabilities 12V.
                    </p>
                    <p id="paragraph" class="lead">
                        The downside to parallel systems is that high amperage is difficult to travel long distances without using very thick wires. Systems as high as 1000 Watts might end up outputting over 50 amps which is very difficult to transfer, especially in the systems
                        were your panels are more than 10 feet from your controller, in which case you would have to go to 4 AWG or thicker which can be expensive in long run. Also, paralleling systems require extra equipment such as branch connectors
                        or combiner box.
                    </p>
                    <h5>Why Series?</h5>
                    <p id="paragraph" class="lead">
                        Strictly series connections are mostly utilized in smaller systems with a MPPT Controller. Connecting your panels in series will increase the voltage level and keep the amperage the same. The reason why series connections are utilized with MPPT controllers
                        is that MPPT Controllers actually are able to accept a higher voltage input, and still be able to charge your 12V or more batteries. The benefit of series is that it is easy to transfer over long distances. For example you can
                        have 4 100 Watt panels in series, run it 100 feet and only use a thin 14 gauge wire.
                    </p>
                    <p id="paragraph" class="lead">
                        The downside to series systems is shading problems. When panels are wired in series, they all in a sense depend on each other. If one panel is shaded it will affect the whole string. This will not happen in a parallel connection.
                    </p>
                    <h5>Why Series-Parallel</h5>
                    <p id="paragraph" class="lead">
                        Solar Panel arrays are usually limited by one factor, the charge controller. Charge controllers are only designed to accept a certain amount of amperage and voltage. Often times for larger systems, in order to stay within those parameters of amperage
                        and voltage, we have to be creative and utilize a series parallel connection.
                    </p>
                    <p id="paragraph" class="lead">
                        For this connection, a string is created by 2 or more panels in series. Then, an equal string needs to be created and paralleled. 4 panels in series needs to be parallel with another 4 panels in series or there will be some serious power loss. You can
                        see more in the example below.
                    </p>
                    <p id="paragraph" class="lead">
                        There isn’t really a downside to series-parallel connections. They are usually used when needed and other options are not available.

                    <h5>Setting up Your System in Parallel</h5>
                    <p id="paragraph" class="lead">
                        A Parallel connection is accomplished by joining the positives of two panels together, as well as the negatives of each panel together. This can be accomplished by different means, but usually for smaller systems this will be utilized via branch connector.
                        The branch connector has a Y shape, and one has two inputs for positive, which changes to one, along with two inputs for negative, which changes for one. Please see picture below.

                        As you can see you have a slot for the negative terminal of panel #1 and the negative terminal of panel #2. As well as the positive equivalents. Then the negative out and the positive out will be utilized to connect to your charge controller via a solar
                        PV cable. See the picture below.

                        Let’s look at a numerical example. Say you have 2 x 100 Watt solar panels and a 12V battery bank. Since each panel is 12V and the battery bank you want to charge is 12V, then you need to parallel your system to keep the voltage the same. The operating
                        voltage is 18.9V and the operating current is 5.29 amps. Paralleling the system would keep the voltage the same and increase the amps by the number of panels paralleled. In this case you have 5.29 Amps x 2 = 10.58 Amps. Voltage
                        stays at 18.9 Volts. To check math you can do 10.58 amps x 18.9 volts = 199.96 Watts, or pretty much 200 Watts.
                    </p>
                    <em id="paragraph">*If you want to check math it won’t work with the open circuit voltage. You can use the operating voltage, so 18.9 volts x 2 = 37.8 volts. 37.8 volts x 5.29 amps = 199.96 Watts, or pretty much 200 Watts.</em>

                    <p id="paragraph" class="lead">
                        A series-parallel connection is accomplished by using both a series and a parallel connection. Every time you group panels together in series, whether is 2, 4, 10, 100, etc. this is called a string. When doing a series-parallel connection, you are essentially
                        paralleling 2 or more equal strings together. See diagram below
                    </p>

                    <p id="paragraph" class="lead">
                        As you can see this series parallel connection has 2 strings of 4 panels. The strings are paralleled together. Let’s look at a numerical example for this diagram. Using a 40 Amp MPPT Controller that can accept up to 800 Watts of power, but only can accept
                        100 Volts in, which is why you cannot do everything in series. Paralleling 8 panels as well would cause too high of an amperage.
                    </p>
                    <p id="paragraph" class="lead">
                        For this example, you would use the open circuit voltage of 22.5 Volts and the operating current of 5.29 Amps. Creating a string of 4 panels, you will have a voltage of 22.5 Volts x 4 = 90 volts, which is under the 100 Volt limit. Then by paralleling
                        on the other string, the voltage will stay 90 volts and the amps will double, so 5.29 amps x 2 = 10.58 Amps.
                    </p>
                    <em id="paragraph">
                        * Keep in mind there is usually another factor that needs to be taken into account when sizing for the MPPT Controller called the boost current.
                    <br>
                        *If you want to check math it won’t work with the open circuit voltage. You can use the operating voltage, so 18.9 volts x 4 = 75.6 volts. 75.6 Volts x 10.58 amps = 799.85 Watts, or pretty much 800 Watts.
